# Tic Tac Toe

## Project 1

This is the first project for Web Development Immersive course. This game was created from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Process

The HTML and CSS of building this game was very basic approach, the CSS was mostly formatted using flex box to make it easier to get the layout. 


The Javascript was somewhat fun and frustrating to work with, here is the followed steps to get the game working:


First a prompt was used to let the user choose if they wanted to start playing using X on O, then jquery was used to sign a click event, when the user click on any of the cells it will add a class to the cell which then was a sign to change the background image and color.

Then, if statement was used to change between X or O. Next another if statement was used to define all the possible ways of winning which then the result to announce the winner and end the game.
